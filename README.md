# Never-Trust
The title to this project is The challenge of implementing zero trust model for network security. In this project, I went over all challenges Network Security may have or could face if a zero trust model was ever implemented into the system. Throughout the project I have provided a problem statement, research questions, purpose of research, case studies, and also methodologies supporting my information on how challenging this task can overall be. At the end of the project as well, you'll also be able to locate references that are based on my information provided.
